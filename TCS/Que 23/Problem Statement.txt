1. Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.

Test case:

Number 1 – 20

Number 2 – 20.38

Sum = 40.38

There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.
