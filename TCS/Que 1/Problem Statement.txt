TCS NQT Coding Question 2022 – September Day 1 – Slot 1
Problem Statement – An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
 

The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

 

Example :

Input :

200  -> Value of V
540   -> Value of W
Output :

TW =130 FW=70
 

Explanation:

130+70 = 200 vehicles

(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

 

Constraints :

2<=W
W%2=0
V<W
 

Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.

First Input line – Accept value of V.
Second Input line- Accept value for W.
 

The output format for testing 

Written program code should generate two outputs, each separated by a single space character(see the example)
Additional messages in the output will result in the failure of test case
