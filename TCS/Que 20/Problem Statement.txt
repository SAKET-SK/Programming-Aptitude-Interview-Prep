Consider the following series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243, 64, 729, 128, 2187 …

This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.

The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than value of n th term,no other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example , if N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.

You can assume that N will not exceed 30.
