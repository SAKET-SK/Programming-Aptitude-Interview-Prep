Question:8
(Asked in Accenture OnCampus 12 Aug 2021, Slot 2)

N-base notation is a system for writing numbers that uses only n different symbols, This symbols are the first n symbols from the given notation list(Including the symbol for o) Decimal to n base notation are (0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9, 10:A,11:B and so on upto 35:Z)

Implement the following function

Char* DectoNBase(int n, int num):

The function accept positive integer n and num Implement the function to calculate the n-base equivalent of num and return the same as a string

Steps:

Divide the decimal number by n,Treat the division as the integer division
Write the the remainder (in  n-base notation)
Divide the quotient again by n, Treat the division as integer division
Repeat step 2 and 3 until the quotient is 0
The n-base value is the sequence of the remainders from last to first
Assumption:

1 < n < = 36

Example

Input

n: 12

num: 718

Output

4BA

Explanation

num       Divisor       quotient       remainder

718           12               59                 10(A)

59             12                4                   11(B)

4               12                0                   4(4)

Sample Input

n: 21

num: 5678

Sample Output

CI8
