Question 2: 
(Asked in Accenture OnCampus 10 Aug 2021, Slot 2)

Problem Description :

The Binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1 and number system can be called binary string. You are required to implement the following function:

int OperationsBinaryString(char* str);

The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits eparated with an alphabet as follows:

– A denotes AND operation
– B denotes OR operation
– C denotes XOR Operation
You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one opearation at a time, and return the same.

Note:

No order of priorities of operations is required
Length of str is odd
If str is NULL or None (in case of Python), return -1
Input:

str: 1C0C1C1A0B1

Output:

1

Explanation:

The alphabets in str when expanded becomes “1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 AND 0 OR 1”, result of the expression becomes 1, hence 1 is returned.

Sample Input:

0C1A1B1C1C1B0A0

Output:

0
