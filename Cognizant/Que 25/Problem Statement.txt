Problem Statement – How will we represent a binary tree? We can use a bracket structure for all of the edges, like (Parentnode , Childnode). Now if we use a node in a child node more than once, the tree can not be valid. Same for the parent node, a node can not be taken more than twice in  a graph as a parent node.

Suppose we see this one graph

(P,Q)(P,R)(Q,T)(R,W)(U,V)(Q,S)(R,U)(U,Z)(S,I)(W,Y)

A tree with those edges may be illustrated in many ways.Here are two:

                   P                            P

                /    \                        /     \

              Q      R                   Q      R

            /   \     /    \               /   \    /  \

          S   T   U   W           S    T  U  W

            \        / \     \          /          / \      \

             I     V  Z    Y      I         Z  V    Y

The following is a recursive definition for the S-expression of a tree.

S-exp(node)=(node->val(S-exp(node->first_child))(S-exp(node->second_child))),if node

!NULL=””,node= =NULL

         Where first_child->val<second _child->val(first_child->val is lexicographically than second_child->val)

This tree can be represented in S-expression in multiple ways.The lexicographically smallest way of expressing it as follows:

P(Q(S(I))(T))(R(U(V)(Z))(W(Y))))

 

Translate the node-pair representation into its lexicographically smallest S-expression or report any errors that do not conform to the definition of the binary tree.

The List of errors with their codes is as follows: 

 

Error                               Reason

Code Stopped1                More than 2 children

Code Stopped2                Duplicate Edges

Code Stopped3                Cycle Present(node is direct descendant of more than one node)

Code Stopped4                Multiple Roots

Code Stopped5                Any other error

 

Functional Description

 

Complete the function sExpression in the editor below.

The function must return either the lexicographically lowest S-expression or the lexicographically lowest error code as a string.
 

sExpression has the following parameter(s):

Nodes:a string of space-separated parenthetical elements,each of which contains the name of two nodes connected by a comma.
 

Constraints:

All node names are single characters in the range ascii[A-Z].
The maximum node count is 26.
There is no specific order to the input (parent,child) pairs.

A representation of tree is as follows:

 

             A

           /    \

         B      C

         /         \

       D           F
