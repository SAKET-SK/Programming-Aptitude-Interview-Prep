There is a scheme declared in theatre, in which one ticket gets a 10% discount on the total cost of tickets if there is a bulk booking which is more than 20 tickets, and if there is a special coupon card then there is 2% discount on total the cost. Also, customer can buy Refreshments which additional cost of Rs. 50 per person.

The cost of the K class Rs. 75 and the Q class is Rs. 150.

Write a program to find the total cost as per the scheme.

Note: In-class K and class Q, you have to buy at a time the minimum of 5 tickets and a maximum of 40. If this condition fails then display the message “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”.
