Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.
Example 1:

Input:
A = 14 , B = 8
Output:
56 2
Explanation:
LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while
thier GCD is 2.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lcmAndGcd() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a List of two Integers, the required LCM and GCD.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= A,B <= 10^18
