Given a number N, calculate the prime numbers up to N using Sieve of Eratosthenes.  

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10

Output:
2 3 5 7

Explanation:
Prime numbers less than equal to N 
are 2 3 5 and 7.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 35

Output:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31

Explanation:
Prime numbers less than equal to 35 are
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 and 31.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sieveOfEratosthenes() which takes an integer N as an input parameter and return the list of prime numbers less than equal to N.

Expected Time Complexity: O(NloglogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1<= N <= 10^4
