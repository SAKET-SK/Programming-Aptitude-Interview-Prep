Given a number N.Find if the digit sum(or sum of digits) of N is a Palindrome number or not.
Note:A Palindrome number is a number which stays the same when reversed.Example- 121,131,7 etc.

Example 1:

Input:
N=56
Output:
1
Explanation:
The digit sum of 56 is 5+6=11.
Since, 11 is a palindrome number.Thus,
answer is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N=98
Output:
0
Explanation:
The digit sum of 98 is 9+8=17.
Since 17 is not a palindrome,thus, answer
is 0.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print aything.Your Task is to complete the function isDigitSumPalindrome() which takes a number N as input parameter and returns 1 if the Digit sum of N is a palindrome.Otherwise it returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity:O(LogN)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^9
