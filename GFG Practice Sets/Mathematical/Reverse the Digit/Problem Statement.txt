Given N,  reverse the digits of N.
 

Example 1:

Input: 200
Output: 2
Explanation: By reversing the digts of 
number, number will change into 2.
Example 2:

Input : 122
Output: 221
Explanation: By reversing the digits of 
number, number will change into 221.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reverse_digit() which takes N as input parameter and returns the reversed number.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^15
