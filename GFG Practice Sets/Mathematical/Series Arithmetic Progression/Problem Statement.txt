Given the first 2 terms A1 and A2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the Nth term of the series. 

Example 1:

Input:
A1=2
A2=3
N=4
Output:
5
Explanation:
The series is 2,3,4,5,6....
Thus,4th term is 5.
Example 2:

Input:
A1=1
A2=2
N=10
Output:
10
Explanation:
The series is1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11..
Thus,10th term is 10.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the function nthTermOfAP() which takes three integers A1,A2 and N as input parameters and returns the nth term of the AP that has A1 and A2 as the first and second terms respectively.


Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)


Constraints:
-10^4<=A1,A2<=10^4
1<=N<=10^3
