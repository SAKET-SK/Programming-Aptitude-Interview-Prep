Given two binary strings A and B that represent value of two integers, find the product of two strings in Decimal Value.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = "1100" , B = "01"
Output:
12
Explanation:
Decimal representation of A is 12 and
that of B is 1. So, A*B gives the
output 12.
Example 2:

Input:
A = "01" , B = "01"
Output:
1
Explanation:
Decimal representation of both A and 
B is 1. So, A*B gives the output 1.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function karatsubaAlgo() which takes Strings A and B as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of Binary String)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= |A|,|B| <= 25
