Given two positive numbers X and Y, check if Y is a power of X or not.

 

Example 1:

Input:
X = 2, Y = 8
Output:
1
Explanation:
2^3 is equal to 8.
 

Example 2:

Input:
X = 1, Y = 3
Output:
0
Explanation:
Any power of 1 is not 
equal to 8.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPowerOfAnother() which takes an integer and returns 1 if y is the power of x, else return 0.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints: 
1 <= x <= 10^3
1 <= y <= 10^8
