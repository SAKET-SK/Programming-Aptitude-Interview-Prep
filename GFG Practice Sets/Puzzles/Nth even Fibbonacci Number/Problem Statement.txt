Given a positive integer N, find the Nth Even Fibonacci number. Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 1000000007.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 2 
Explanation: 2 is the first even
number in the fibonacci series.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 8 is the second even
number in the fibonacci series.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function nthEvenFibonacci() which takes S as input parameter and returns the Nth even fibonacci number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1<= n <=1000
