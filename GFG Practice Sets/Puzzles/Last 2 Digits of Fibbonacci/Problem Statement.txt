Given a number N. Find the last two digits of the Nth fibonacci number.
Note: If the last two digits are 02, return 2.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 13
Output:
33
Explanation:
The 13th Fibonacci number is 233.
So last two digits are 3 and 3.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 255
Output:
70
Explanation:
The 255th fibonacci number is  875715953430-
18854458033386304178158174356588264390370.
Thus, last two digits are 7 and 0.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function fibonacciDigits() which takes a number N as input parameter and returns the last two digits of the Nth fibonacci number.
