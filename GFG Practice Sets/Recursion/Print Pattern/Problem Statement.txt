Print a sequence of numbers starting with N where A[0] = N, without using loop, in which  A[i+1] = A[i] - 5,  until A[i] > 0. After that A[i+1] = A[i] + 5  repeat it until A[i] = N.

Example 1:

Input: N = 16
Output: 16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
Explaination: The value decreses until it 
is greater than 0. After that it increases 
and stops when it becomes 16 again.
Example 2:

Input: N = 10
Output: 10 5 0 5 10
Explaination: It follows the same logic as 
per the above example.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pattern() which takes N as input parameters and returns a list containing the pattern.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
